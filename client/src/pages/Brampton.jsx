              In 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets. Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at the market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern Brampton Fall Fair.

              <p className="text-dark text-justify">In that same year Brampton was incorporated as a village.[9] In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the Peel County Courthouse which was built in 1865â€“66; a three-storey County jail was added at the rear in 1867.</p>

              <p className="mb-0 text-dark text-justify">Edward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, established a flower nursery in Brampton[10] shortly after his arrival in 1863.[11] Dale's Nursery became the town's largest[10] and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,[11] and established a global export market for its products.[10] The company chimney was a town landmark,[11] until Brampton Town Council allowed it to be torn down in 1977.[11] At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,[12] and was the largest cut flower business in North America,[13] producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.[13] It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town. Forty-eight hothouse flower nurseries once did business in the town</p>
